Executive Summary:
        considered a standalone document
        breifly expain details, no new info.

Table Of Contents:

Introduction:
        Nature of analysis: To analyize SpaceX data for bidding insight
        States the problem: Be able to predict flight outcomes to aid in bidding for contracts
        States questions for analysis: What features affect flight success outcomes? Launch Site, Payload, Landing Site, Contractor

Methodology:
        A) Explains the data sources: 
        B) Outlines the plan for collected data: 
        Data was obtained from SpaceX using their API to retieve the json response.  
        Data was obtained from webscraping Wikepedia data in a HTML response. 
        API data was collected and normalized into a dataframe. Values that were 
        ID numbers were queried for more useful information and stored in csv format.
        Webscraping data was turned into beautiful soup, parsed into a Dataframe and 
        stored as a csv file. Data was filtered based on Falcon 9 rockets, missing 
        data was filled with mean values where appropriate. One hot Encoding was 
        applied to category values like Outcomes, 1 for successful 0 for not.  

Results:
        organized and analyized
        charts and graphs to support results and any extra findindings.

Discussion:
        engage audience to give an explanation for findings

Conclusion:
        Reiterate problems given in the introduction.
        Give an overall summary of the findings
        State outcome of analysis and any future steps.

Appendix:
        Info that didnt fit in the main body fo the report, but deemed important to include
        Can include locations where data was collected, resources, acknowledgements, or refrences.
